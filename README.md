# Active-Directory Lab

## Objective


The Active-Directory Lab project is aimed to To deepen my expertise in cybersecurity and system administration by building a secure home lab that integrates Splunk for SIEM, Kali Linux for offensive security testing, and Atomic Red Team for simulating real-world attacks—enabling hands-on experience with domain environments, event telemetry, and threat detection.

### Skills Learned

- Active Directory Administration: Set up and managed a secure domain environment, including user/group management and domain controller configuration.

- SIEM Integration: Ingested and analyzed Windows event logs using Splunk to detect suspicious activity.

- Threat Simulation: Deployed Atomic Red Team to emulate real-world attack techniques and test detection capabilities.

- Offensive Security Testing: Utilized Kali Linux to simulate adversarial behavior and validate detection logic.

- Telemetry Generation: Produced meaningful security telemetry through attack simulations for use in detection engineering.

- Log Analysis & Correlation: Developed an understanding of event flow from endpoint to SIEM, improving log parsing and correlation strategies.

- Security Monitoring: Built alert logic based on attack techniques mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

- Lab Infrastructure Setup: Created a self-contained home lab using virtualization to simulate enterprise environments safely.

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2022 – for Active Directory domain setup and event generation
- Active Directory – to manage users, groups, policies, and domain services
- Splunk – for ingesting, analyzing, and alerting on security telemetry (SIEM)
- Kali Linux – for conducting offensive security tests and simulating attacker behavior
- Atomic Red Team – to emulate real-world attack techniques and generate detection-relevant telemetry
- Sysmon – for enhanced system-level logging and detailed event collection
- PowerShell – for automation, script-based administration, and data manipulation
- VirtualBox – for building and isolating the lab environment in a virtualized setting
- Ubuntu Server – for additional server roles or supporting services (optional use)
